MAIN PROJECT PLANHealth & Nutrition Tracking App – AI Food Recognition First

PRIMARY MVP GOAL
The very first feature of this project is:
- Take a photo (camera or upload) of food
- Use AI to identify the food and ingredients
- Pull nutrition facts from reputable databases
- Log daily intake automatically

This feature comes BEFORE community, challenges, or messaging.

PHASE 0 – AI FOOD RECOGNITION MVP (FOUNDATION)
This phase is mandatory and blocks all other features.

User Flow:
1. User opens app
2. Clicks “Take Photo” or “Upload Image”
3. AI analyzes the image
4. App returns:
   - Food name(s)
   - Ingredients (if applicable)
   - Calories
   - Protein, Carbs, Fat
5. User confirms or edits result
6. Data is saved to daily log

Why this first:
- Core value of the app
- Hardest technical problem
- Everything else depends on accurate nutrition data

AI & DATA SOURCES (REPUTABLE)
Food Identification (AI Vision):
- Google Cloud Vision API (Food & Object Detection)
- OR OpenAI Vision (image → food description)
- OR CalorieMama API (food-specific model)

Nutrition Databases:
- USDA FoodData Central (official US government source)
- Nutritionix API (commercial, widely used)
- OpenFoodFacts (open, global database)

AI Logic:
1. Vision AI → identify food name(s)
2. NLP step → normalize food names
3. Nutrition API → fetch macros & calories
4. Confidence score returned
5. User confirmation required

- Manual edit / correction

PHASE 2 – DASHBOARD
- Daily summary
- Weekly trends
- Weight tracking (manual input)

PHASE 3 – COMMUNITY (LATER)
- Sharing
- Challenges
- Leaderboards
- Messaging

PLATFORM
- Web App first (mobile-friendly)
